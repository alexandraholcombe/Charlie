    <h2>My New Year's Weekend!!</h2>
    <p>My favorite person was at work all day so I grabbed my Baby Gator and dragged it into her old room and sniffed around in her closet!</p>
    <p>Oh! I took a nap on my snuggle bed which is blue and soft</p>
    <p>Other activities I did this weekend include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Playing with Franke</li>
      <li>Snuggling dad</li>
      <li>Sniffing the backyard</li>
    </ul>
